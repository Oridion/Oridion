# üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY AUDIT ‚Äî Oridion Smart Contract

**Last reviewed:** September 9, 2025  
**Audit scope:** `oridion_anchor` Solana program and AWS-integrated backend system.

---

## üîç Overview

This audit covers the on-chain and off-chain logic of the Oridion protocol ‚Äî a privacy-focused Solana program that obfuscates SOL deposits through randomized planetary and star ‚Äúhops.‚Äù  
This version introduces **hash ticket withdrawals**, **automated pod delivery**, stronger **replay protection**, and improved **backend Lambda orchestration** that ensures finality at every step.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Updates (Post-Redeploy)

### ‚úÖ Automated Pod Delivery
- Users now submit only **amount**, **destination**, and **delay**.
- Backend automation (AWS Lambda + EventBridge) handles randomized hops during the delay.
- Pods are auto-landed when the delay expires ‚Äî no manual withdrawal needed.

### ‚úÖ Hash Ticket Withdrawals
- Withdrawals require a **hash-based ticket** generated at pod creation.
- Tickets unlink the creator from the withdrawal transaction.
- Stored in a PDA ring buffer with replay prevention (deleted after use).

### ‚úÖ Multi-Step Finalized Hops
- All hop flows (`planet_hop`, `scatter_hop`, `star_hop_*`) finalize between phases.
- Sequence now enforced: `lock_planet` ‚ûù `hop_start` ‚ûù finalization ‚ûù `hop_end`.

### ‚úÖ Replay Protection
- Withdrawals validate:
  - Lamport balances
  - `is_in_transit`
  - `next_process_at` flags
- Hash tickets + in-transit flags make replay attacks impractical.

### ‚úÖ PDA Lifecycle Management
- Accounts closed post-use to reduce rent bloat.
- Deposit PDAs now contain inline activity logs (ring buffer of 20).
- StarMeta and hop accounts closed after use.

### ‚úÖ Discriminator Verification
- Instruction discriminators tracked in decimal form by internal script.
- Cross-checked with deployed IDL for consistency.

## üß† Key Findings (Updated)

### 1. ‚úÖ Deposit & Hop Integrity
- `star_hop` and `scatter_hop` enforce strict lamport splitting with `require!()`.
- Final balance after hops always equals original deposit.

### 2. ‚úÖ Withdrawal Privacy & Replay Protection
- Withdrawals validated via hash tickets, lamport checks, and in-transit flags.
- Breaks link between deposit creator and withdrawal address.

### 3. ‚úÖ PDA Cleanup
- `#[account(close = manager)]` pattern supported where feasible.
- Manual `.lamports() == 0` guards prevent PDA re-use.

### 4. ‚úÖ Secure PDA Derivation
- All PDAs derived via `Pubkey::find_program_address` with bump validation.
- Replay-prevention guards ensure uniqueness.

### 5. ‚úÖ Authority & Backend Finality
- Off-chain orchestrators wait for finalization between each hop.
- Instructions enforce strict key validation (`require_keys_eq!`).

## üßæ Final Thoughts

The Oridion protocol continues to harden its privacy and safety guarantees. Recent improvements ‚Äî particularly **automated pod delivery** and **hash ticket withdrawals** ‚Äî make the system simpler for users while significantly strengthening unlinkability.

Notable strengths:
- Finalization between all hops reduces MEV and state race risks
- Replay protection via hash tickets and state flags
- Minimal logging reduces traceability
- Backend orchestration ensures reliability and full automation

Remaining work: expand event visibility for better developer tooling and broaden automated test coverage for new flows.
