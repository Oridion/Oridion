# üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY AUDIT ‚Äî Oridion Smart Contract

**Last reviewed:** July 20, 2025  
**Audit scope:** `oridion_anchor` Solana program and AWS-integrated backend system.

---

## üîç Overview

This audit covers the on-chain and off-chain logic of the Oridion protocol ‚Äî a privacy-focused Solana program that scrambles SOL deposits via planetary and star ‚Äúhops,‚Äù making transfers more difficult to trace. This version includes improved transaction ordering, safer PDA handling, secure randomness, and new off-chain Lambda orchestration logic that ensures finality at every step.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Updates (Post-Redeploy)

### ‚úÖ Multi-Step Finalized Hops
- All `planet_hop`, `scatter_hop`, and `star_hop_*` instructions are now executed with confirmed finality between each phase.
- This includes:
   - `lock_planet` ‚ûù Finalized
   - `star_hop_*_start` ‚ûù Finalized
   - `star_hop_*_end` ‚ûù Finalized

### ‚úÖ Replay Protection
- `withdraw` and `scatter` paths now include lamport checks and `is_in_transit` / `next_process_at` flags to prevent re-use.
- Custom PDA replay guard implemented using `.lamports() == 0` checks before account creation.

### ‚úÖ PDA Lifecycle Management
- Future-proofing logic includes optional integration of `#[account(close = manager)]` patterns, though currently managed off-chain.
- Deposit and star accounts are now tracked with inline activity logs (circular buffer of 20 entries) instead of separate PDAs.

### ‚úÖ Discriminator Verification
- Instruction discriminators are now parsed, tracked, and validated in decimal via an internal script, ensuring alignment with deployed IDL and client interfaces.

---

## üß† Key Findings (Updated)

### 1. ‚úÖ Deposit Hop Math Integrity
- `star_hop` instructions continue to strictly enforce lamport splitting logic using `require!()`.
- Final destination sum always equals initial deposit.

### 2. ‚úÖ Withdraw Replay Prevention
- New design includes `is_in_transit`, `next_process_at`, and lamport balance checks before allowing withdrawal.
- Prevents multiple invocations using stale deposit PDAs.

### 3. ‚úÖ PDA Cleanup Implemented
- Deposit accounts are properly closed during withdrawal via `#[account(close = manager)]`.
- Star and StarMeta accounts are closed at the end of `star_hop` instructions.
- Reduces rent bloat and ensures efficient on-chain footprint.

### 4. ‚úÖ Secure PDA Derivation + Manual Verification
- All PDAs derived via `Pubkey::find_program_address` with verified bumps.
- Manual `.lamports() == 0` guard added before serializing new accounts to avoid reinitialization exploits.

### 5. ‚úÖ Authority & Key Checks Enhanced
- Planet hop and related instructions now enforce stricter key validation (e.g., `require_keys_eq!`).
- SQS-triggered flows validate deposit ownership, location, and destination compatibility before signing.

## üîê Risk Summary

| Category               | Risk Level | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Re-entrancy            | Low        | No external CPI calls modify program state recursively                |
| Integer Overflow       | Low        | Lamport math is assert-bound and split verified                       |
| Replay Attacks         | Low        | Withdraw and hop logic includes in-transit flags + lamport checks     |
| Invalid State Handling | Low        | State transitions gated via `next_process_at` and hop sequence        |
| Finality Enforcement   | Low        | All off-chain functions wait for finalization before proceeding       |

## üßæ Final Thoughts

The Oridion protocol is nearing production-level security with robust logic and thoughtful handling of multi-transaction flows. Notable strengths include:

- Finalization between all steps, improving correctness and reducing MEV risk
- Discriminator validation tools for dev security
- Replay protection and in-transit state flags
- Off-chain logic (Lambda functions) that complements on-chain safety

Remaining improvements are relatively minor and mostly around **visibility** (events). Once these are added, the protocol will be fully hardened for use in wallets like **Orbi / SKRAMBL**.
